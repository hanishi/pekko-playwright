üï∑Ô∏è Crawler

Apache Pekko-based web crawler using Playwright to extract structured text and link data from dynamic websites.

This project combines the concurrency model of Apache Pekko with the browser automation power of Microsoft Playwright to build a scalable, 
actor-based scraping system. 

It supports:

- Headless browser automation
- DOM content extraction
- Click-based interaction (e.g. expand buttons)
- Retry logic and error handling
- Parallel scraping via actor supervision
